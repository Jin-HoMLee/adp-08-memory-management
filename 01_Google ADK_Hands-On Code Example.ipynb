    "The Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK) offers a structured method for managing context and memory, including components for practical application. A solid grasp of ADK's Session, State, and Memory is vital for building agents that need to retain information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in human interactions, agents require the ability to recall previous exchanges to conduct coherent and natural conversations. ADK simplifies context management through three core concepts and their associated services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every interaction with an agent can be considered a unique conversation thread. Agents might need to access data from earlier interactions. ADK structures this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Session:** An individual chat thread that logs messages and actions (Events) for that specific interaction, also storing temporary data (State) relevant to that conversation.\n",
    "- **State (session.state):** Data stored within a Session, containing information relevant only to the current, active chat thread.\n",
    "- **Memory:** A searchable repository of information sourced from various past chats or external sources, serving as a resource for data retrieval beyond the immediate conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADK provides dedicated services for managing critical components essential for building complex, stateful, and context-aware agents. The SessionService manages chat threads (Session objects) by handling their initiation, recording, and termination, while the MemoryService oversees the storage and retrieval of long-term knowledge (Memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the SessionService and MemoryService offer various configuration options, allowing users to choose storage methods based on application needs. In-memory options are available for testing purposes, though data will not persist across restarts. For persistent storage and scalability, ADK also supports database and cloud-based services."

    "A Session object in ADK is designed to track and manage individual chat threads. Upon initiation of a conversation with an agent, the SessionService generates a Session object, represented as `google.adk.sessions.Session`. This object encapsulates all data relevant to a specific conversation thread, including unique identifiers (id, app_name, user_id), a chronological record of events as Event objects, a storage area for session-specific temporary data known as state, and a timestamp indicating the last update (last_update_time). Developers typically interact with Session objects indirectly through the SessionService. The SessionService is responsible for managing the lifecycle of conversation sessions, which includes initiating new sessions, resuming previous sessions, recording session activity (including state updates), identifying active sessions, and managing the removal of session data. The ADK provides several SessionService implementations with varying storage mechanisms for session history and temporary data, such as the InMemorySessionService, which is suitable for testing but does not provide data persistence across application restarts."

The Session then awaits the next message. Ideally, the delete_session method is employed to terminate the session when the interaction concludes.

    "\n",
    "In the ADK, each Session, representing a chat thread, includes a state component akin to an agent's temporary working memory for the duration of that specific conversation. While session.events logs the entire chat history, session.state stores and updates dynamic data points relevant to the active chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, session.state operates as a dictionary, storing data as key-value pairs. Its core function is to enable the agent to retain and manage details essential for coherent dialogue, such as user preferences, task progress, incremental data collection, or conditional flags influencing subsequent agent actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stateâ€™s structure comprises string keys paired with values of serializable Python types, including strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries containing these basic types. State is dynamic, evolving throughout the conversation. The permanence of these changes depends on the configured SessionService.\n",
    "\n",
    "State organization can be achieved using key prefixes to define data scope and persistence. Keys without prefixes are session-specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The user: prefix associates data with a user ID across all sessions. \n",
    "- The app: prefix designates data shared among all users of the application. \n",
    "- The temp: prefix indicates data valid only for the current processing turn and is not persistently stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent accesses all state data through a single session.state dictionary. The SessionService handles data retrieval, merging, and persistence. State should be updated upon adding an Event to the session history via session_service.append_event(). This ensures accurate tracking, proper saving in persistent services, and safe handling of state changes."

    "When we update the session state directly inside the `log_user_login()` tool (by modifying session.state), those changes were only made in memory â€” they were not automatically persisted by the session service. As a result, when we now retrieve the session using get_session_async(), the state would not reflect the changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This happens because ADKâ€™s session persistence relies on events: only changes recorded via `session_service.append_event(session, event)` (or by the Runner when processing agent outputs) are saved and made available in future session retrievals. Direct modifications to `session.state` are not persisted unless you explicitly record them as an event. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Direct changes to `session.state` are not automatically saved.\n",
    "- You must use the session serviceâ€™s event system to persist state changes for them to be reflected in future session retrievals.\n",
    "\n",
    "P.S.: The third paragraph of the explanatory text after the code section also addresses this issue. However, at that time and Google ADK version, directly updating `session.state` from within a tool still seemed to work. "

    "This code demonstrates a tool-based approach for managing user session state in an application. It defines a function log_user_login, which acts as a tool. This tool is responsible for updating the session state when a user logs in.\n",
    "The function takes a ToolContext object, provided by the ADK, to access and modify the session's state dictionary. Inside the tool, it increments a user:login_count, sets the task_status to \"active\", records the user:last_login_ts (timestamp), and adds a temporary flag temp:validation_needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The demonstration part of the code simulates how this tool would be used. It sets up an in-memory session service and creates an initial session with some predefined state. A ToolContext is then manually created to mimic the environment in which the ADK Runner would execute the tool. The log_user_login function is called with this mock context. Finally, the code retrieves the session again to show that the state has been updated by the tool's execution. The goal is to show how encapsulating state changes within tools makes the code cleaner and more organized compared to directly manipulating state outside of tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that direct modification of the `session.state` dictionary after retrieving a session is strongly discouraged as it bypasses the standard event processing mechanism. Such direct changes will not be recorded in the session's event history, may not be persisted by the selected `SessionService`, could lead to concurrency issues, and will not update essential metadata such as timestamps. The recommended methods for updating the session state are using the `output_key` parameter on an `LlmAgent` (specifically for the agent's final text responses) or including state changes within `EventActions.state_delta` when appending an event via `session_service.append_event()`. The `session.state` should primarily be used for reading existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, when designing your state, keep it simple, use basic data types, give your keys clear names and use prefixes correctly, avoid deep nesting, and always update state using the append_event process."
