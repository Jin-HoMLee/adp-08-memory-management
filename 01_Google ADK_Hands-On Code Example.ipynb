    "The Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK) offers a structured method for managing context and memory, including components for practical application. A solid grasp of ADK's Session, State, and Memory is vital for building agents that need to retain information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in human interactions, agents require the ability to recall previous exchanges to conduct coherent and natural conversations. ADK simplifies context management through three core concepts and their associated services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every interaction with an agent can be considered a unique conversation thread. Agents might need to access data from earlier interactions. ADK structures this as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Session:** An individual chat thread that logs messages and actions (Events) for that specific interaction, also storing temporary data (State) relevant to that conversation.\n",
    "- **State (session.state):** Data stored within a Session, containing information relevant only to the current, active chat thread.\n",
    "- **Memory:** A searchable repository of information sourced from various past chats or external sources, serving as a resource for data retrieval beyond the immediate conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADK provides dedicated services for managing critical components essential for building complex, stateful, and context-aware agents. The SessionService manages chat threads (Session objects) by handling their initiation, recording, and termination, while the MemoryService oversees the storage and retrieval of long-term knowledge (Memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the SessionService and MemoryService offer various configuration options, allowing users to choose storage methods based on application needs. In-memory options are available for testing purposes, though data will not persist across restarts. For persistent storage and scalability, ADK also supports database and cloud-based services."

    "A Session object in ADK is designed to track and manage individual chat threads. Upon initiation of a conversation with an agent, the SessionService generates a Session object, represented as `google.adk.sessions.Session`. This object encapsulates all data relevant to a specific conversation thread, including unique identifiers (id, app_name, user_id), a chronological record of events as Event objects, a storage area for session-specific temporary data known as state, and a timestamp indicating the last update (last_update_time). Developers typically interact with Session objects indirectly through the SessionService. The SessionService is responsible for managing the lifecycle of conversation sessions, which includes initiating new sessions, resuming previous sessions, recording session activity (including state updates), identifying active sessions, and managing the removal of session data. The ADK provides several SessionService implementations with varying storage mechanisms for session history and temporary data, such as the InMemorySessionService, which is suitable for testing but does not provide data persistence across application restarts."

    "Each message exchange involves a cyclical process: A message is received, the Runner retrieves or establishes a Session using the SessionService, the agent processes the message using the Session's context (state and historical interactions), the agent generates a response and may update the state, the Runner encapsulates this as an Event, and the session_service.append_event method records the new event and updates the state in storage. The Session then awaits the next message. Ideally, the delete_session method is employed to terminate the session when the interaction concludes. This process illustrates how the SessionService maintains continuity by managing the Session-specific history and temporary data."

    "## State: The Session's Scratchpad\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ADK, each Session, representing a chat thread, includes a state component akin to an agent's temporary working memory for the duration of that specific conversation. While session.events logs the entire chat history, session.state stores and updates dynamic data points relevant to the active chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, session.state operates as a dictionary, storing data as key-value pairs. Its core function is to enable the agent to retain and manage details essential for coherent dialogue, such as user preferences, task progress, incremental data collection, or conditional flags influencing subsequent agent actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stateâ€™s structure comprises string keys paired with values of serializable Python types, including strings, numbers, booleans, lists, and dictionaries containing these basic types. State is dynamic, evolving throughout the conversation. The permanence of these changes depends on the configured SessionService.\n",
    "\n",
    "State organization can be achieved using key prefixes to define data scope and persistence. Keys without prefixes are session-specific. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The user: prefix associates data with a user ID across all sessions. \n",
    "- The app: prefix designates data shared among all users of the application. \n",
    "- The temp: prefix indicates data valid only for the current processing turn and is not persistently stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "The agent accesses all state data through a single session.state dictionary. The SessionService handles data retrieval, merging, and persistence. State should be updated upon adding an Event to the session history via session_service.append_event(). This ensures accurate tracking, proper saving in persistent services, and safe handling of state changes."

    "1. **The Simple Way: Using output_key (for Agent Text Replies):** This is the easiest method if you just want to save your agent's final text response directly into the state. When you set up your LlmAgent, just tell it the output_key you want to use. The Runner sees this and automatically creates the necessary actions to save the response to the state when it appends the event. Let's look at a code example demonstrating state update via output_key."
